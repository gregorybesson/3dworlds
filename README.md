# Creating a World

- Create a 2D array of 0 and integers. Integers will represent different kinds of walls.

# Defining Projection Attributes
The screen will be my camera plan. The trick here is that I will parse each x pixel of the screen, looking for 
an intersection with a wall. then, I'll create the resulting vertical.

I need my player object, with position (x, y) and the direction he goes (a vector)
I need my camera plan. Another trick: I want the angle of the camera to be 66Â° for the game to be "realistic". Thanks to CAH SOH TOA trigonometric mnemonic, I can deduce the distance between the camera plan and the player.

# Finding Distance To Projection Plane
Now I will project rays from player position to the camera plan. I need the direction vector of each ray to be able to ray to the walls.
As I'll express the x coordinates based on the real screen size, I need to apply a ratio to it as all my calculations occur in the grid scale. Furthermore, I want the x center of my screen to be the x = 0. my camera plan starting at -1 and finishing at 1. See below the cameraRatio formula.
to calculate the ray dir vector, we add the player dir vector with the norm of the part vector of the x on the camera plan. in cartesian coo.

Calculations:
```
pointVector player;
player.pos.x = 3;
player.pos.y = 3;
player.dir.x = 0;
player.dir.y = -1;

vector cameraPlan;
cameraPlan.x = 1;
cameraPlan.y = 0.66

for(int i=0; i < SCREEN_WIDTH. i++){
  long cameraRatio = (2 * x) / SCREEN_WIDTH - 1;
  pointVector ray;
  ray.pos.x = player.pos.x;
  ray.pos.y = player.pos.y;
  ray.dir.x = player.dir.x + cameraPlan.x X cameraRatio;
  ray.dir.y = player.dir.y + cameraPlan.y X cameraRatio;
}

```

# Finding Walls
if we have a screen: SCREEN_WIDTH=1024, SCREEN_HEIGHT=768
the previous calculation has been done for 1024 rays. Now it's time to find walls. Here comes the DDA algorithm
